It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even link to Google! (http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

    1. One
    2. Two
    3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

    * Start a line with a star
    * Profit!

Alternatively,

    * Dashes work just as well
    * And if you have sub points,
      put two spaces before the dash or star:
        * Like this
        * And this

But also,

    1. And not to forget
       numbered lists
        1. Can also have
        2. Several sub points

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a # to create headings. Multiple ## in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one # all the way up to ###### six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

    Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: var example = true.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }
